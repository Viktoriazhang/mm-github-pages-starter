## What is it about?

To help companies to minimise the damage of a possible economic downturn and position the business to emerge strongly when the economy recovers, a Recession Management Workshop has been being developed based on more than 50 research papers and their thousands of cases. At the same time, an implementation of gamification helps to engage the participants to achieve better results with an enhanced experience.
